# Python Coursework

This repository contains programming assignments completed during my AAI551 Python course. Each assignment builds on foundational skills in Python programming, data structures, and applied problem-solving.

## Homework Overview

| Homework | 
|----------|
| `hw0`    | 
| `hw1`    | 
| `hw2`    |

## How to Use
Each folder contains the original assignment instructions and completed code in either `.py` or `.ipynb` format. Run notebooks in a Jupyter environment or view the `.py` files directly.
