# Python Coursework

This repository contains programming assignments completed during my AAI551 Python course. Each assignment builds on foundational skills in Python programming, data structures, and applied problem-solving.

## Homework Overview

| Homework | Topics Covered                                |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `hw0`    | Python basics, expressions, data types        |
| `hw1`    | Control flow, loops, functions                |
| `hw2`    | Lists, dictionaries, string manipulation      |
| `hw3`    | File I/O, error handling                      |
| `hw4`    | NumPy and array operations                    |
| `hw5`    | Data processing with pandas                   |
| `hw6`    | Data visualization with matplotlib/seaborn    |
| `hw7`    | Final project or capstone assignment          |

## How to Use
Each folder contains the original assignment instructions and completed code in either `.py` or `.ipynb` format. Run notebooks in a Jupyter environment or view the `.py` files directly.
